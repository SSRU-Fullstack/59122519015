    <p>The < p > tag in <u>HTML</u> defines a paragraph. These have both opening and closing tag. So anything mentioned within 
       < p > and < / p > is treated as a paragraph. <i>Most browsers read a line as a paragraph even</i>if we donâ€™t use the closing tag i.e, < / p >
        , but this may raise unexpected results. So,  <b>it is both a good convention</b> and we must use the closing tag.

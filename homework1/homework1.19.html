    <blockquote>
        The decision about what to put into your paragraphs begins with the germination of a seed of ideas;
         this “germination process” is better known as brainstorming. There are many techniques for brainstorming; 
         whichever one you choose, this stage of paragraph development cannot be skipped. 
         Building paragraphs can be like building a skyscraper: there must be a well-planned foundation that supports what you are building. 
         Any cracks, inconsistencies, or other corruptions of the foundation can cause your whole paper to crumble.
